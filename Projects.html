            <span class="heading">My biggest project as of 9/10/24 is most definitely this website.</span>
            I've always had the idea of creating one, heavily inspired by the Youtuber "Network Chucks". I thought it was a great idea for me to gather all my experiences and skills onto a Website that I could show in applications and to employers, and I get to make it look cool.
            <br>
            <br>As a way to kill time productively and finding a new hobby, I started building this website on the 15th of September. I also chose to build it from scratch rather than using website building tools such as WordPress, because wheres the fun in that?
            <br>
            <br><img src="/images/Projects/website1.jpg" class="website1" alt="websitebuilding">
            <br>The code and framework behind the Website can be easily accessed by right-clicking the page and pressing "Inspect" or by pressing F12.
            <span class="heading">How I built it</span>
            Website building is as easy as people make it out. My previous experience with creating Websites was from when I learnt it as part of the National 5 Computing Science curriculum, in where I basically did nothing apart from creating a tiny HTML and CSS file with almost no Javascript.
            I was pretty much building this with next to 0 previous knowledge, as the knowledge I did have before was really vague and limited.
            <br>
            <br>My main way of learning was through Youtube, specifically a Youtuber named BroCode. I have a playlist of the majority of videos I used to learn HTML, CSS and JS, shown by clicking below:
            <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAAVP2mzhS4XPp4AgkPwet2GLRi-xWJ_i&si=Qn-YEX4xrbh_j8NM"><br><span id="ImportantPlaylist">Click Here</span></a>
            In addition, I had to do alot of browsing through GitHub and Stack Overflow comments of people having the same issues I did to trouble shoot problems. I also used websites such as W3Schools and Mdn Web Docs. For tools, I use VSS Code to write everything with HTML, CSS and JS extensions and LiveServer to test the website.
            <br>
            <br>To upload the Website onto the internet, I use GitHub pages and I bought a domain name from Namecheap.com.
